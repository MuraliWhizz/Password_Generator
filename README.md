## Project Overview

PassGen is a mobile application built with React Native to generate passwords based on user input. It also implements haptic feedback for a smooth user experience and uses `formik` for form management with validation powered by `yup`.

## Features

- **Password Generation**: Users can generate strong passwords.
- **Checkbox Animations**: Animated checkboxes are used for user preferences.
- **Haptic Feedback**: Haptic feedback on button press using `react-native-haptic-feedback`.
- **Form Validation**: Form validation with `formik` and `yup`.
- **Linear Gradients**: Beautiful UI with `expo-linear-gradient`.

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: v18 or above.
- **Yarn**: v3.6.4 or above (as the package manager).
- **React Native CLI**: Installed globally for building and running the app.
- **Android Studio/ Xcode**: To run the application on Android/iOS devices or emulators.
  
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/passgen.git
   cd Password_Generator



This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
